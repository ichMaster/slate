"""Dashboard server — tails the log, serves the page, pushes over a WebSocket.

Port **8420**, never 8000: the generated application owns that one and both may run at
once. Reads only ``codegen/runs/``, writes only ``codegen/var/`` (vision §3 principle 6).

It imports nothing from ``server/``, ``firmware/`` or ``apps/`` — those directories are
regenerated and deleted, and this must start and serve with the whole application tree
absent, which is its normal state between runs.

#: Send a frame at least this often, even when the log has not grown.
#:
#: Frames used to be sent ONLY on growth, and a real run is quiet for long stretches: in
#: the v01–v03 run, 23 gaps ran over a minute and the longest was 26. With no frame, the
#: header's elapsed clock stops — it is computed at reduce time — so the page sat
#: motionless for 26 minutes while the pipeline was working and the socket was fine.
#: A stopped clock beside a "live" indicator is not a slow dashboard, it is a wrong one.
#:
#: The cost is one reduction per interval per client: ~10 ms for a 1000-event log. A
#: finished run needs no special case — its elapsed is measured to `ended`, not to now,
#: so the clock stops on its own and the repeated frames are identical.

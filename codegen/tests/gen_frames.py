"""Golden frame generator — the device's equivalent of ``gen_log.py``.

Frames are generated from **presets, never from ``runs/``**. That directory is
gitignored, so a golden frame built from a recorded run would be unreproducible in a
fresh checkout and the test would either fail or skip itself into uselessness. The
generator is deterministic — same preset, same bytes — which is what lets the expected
output be committed.

Regeneration is explicit::

    python3 -m tests.gen_frames --update-golden

Never automatic. A golden file that rewrites itself when the code changes is a file
that asserts nothing.
